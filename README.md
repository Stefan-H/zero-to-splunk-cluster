# zero-to-splunk-cluster

A quick-and-dirty splunk cluster deployment. A mash-up of some bash scripts and terraform to deploy a pretty consistent basic splunk cluster on AWS. Tunable for search factor/replication factor/number of indexers.

I'll update this in the next couple days to have more customization to the ebs volumes on the indexers.

This is really just a playground, but the principles in this might be useful to someone.
